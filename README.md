Program to create patterned tree from variable inputs.
Input height of tree to determine amount of rows, input type to determine what tree is made of.
Upon 'enter'(while in input fields) or clicking 'grow your tree button' program will create a patterned tree in the console.

Current issues: -multiple inputs in type cause pattern to no center with
                spaces;
                need to adjust the spaces to ?length? of type input.
